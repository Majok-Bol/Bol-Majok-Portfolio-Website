              Having had a keen interest in Computer application,I was able to
              complete short computer packages in Microsoft
              Word,Excel,Powerpoint,Publisher,Access and front office in
              Nairobi,Kenya.I traveled to South Sudan in 2021 where I was
              fortunate to serve as a junior manager of Dayan Owandho Institute
              of Computer Studies in Kuajok,Warrap State.It was a great learning
              opportunity.I was able to accomplish tasks ranging from customer
              services to financial management of the institution's financial
              assets.The day to day application of computer skills at the
              workplace really enhanced my experience as a junior manager.Little
              did I know that this would culminate into my interest in Resposive
              Web design and Software development as a whole.
